# ToDo App Exercise - HTML and JavaScript

Welcome to the ToDo App Exercise! In this assignment, you will build a basic ToDo application using only HTML and JavaScript.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
Your task is to create a simple ToDo application that allows a user to:

1. Enter a task using a form.
2. View the entered task appended to an unordered list on the page.

You'll only write in the `exercise.html` file. 
In case you need to see the solution, it is at `the_answer.html`.

## âœ… Specific Tasks (JavaScript):
#### 1. Add an event listener to the form to detect when it's submitted.
#### 2. When the form is submitted, prevent its default behavior (which might refresh the page).
#### 3. Retrieve the task entered by the user from the input field.
#### 4. Create a new list item (`<li>`) and set its inner text or inner HTML to the task retrieved.
#### 5. Append this list item to the unordered list in the HTML.
#### 6. Clear the input field to allow for the entry of a new task.

## ðŸ“˜ How to Run Your Website:
1. Go to the terminal
2. Run the command `http-server`
   It will generate a link in your terminal. Click on that link and you will see your website!

## ðŸš€ How to Run Tests:
After completing the exercise, you can run the provided tests to ensure that your ToDo application is functioning as expected:
1. Go to the terminal
2. Run the command `npm install` to install the things that we need to test your code.
3. Run the command `sudo apt-get update` and then `sudo apt-get install -y libxshmfence1`
4. Run the command `npm test` to execute the tests.
  If all goes well, you should see a message indicating the tests that passed. If there are issues, the failed tests will provide hints or messages to help you identify the problem.

## ðŸ¤” How to Submit:
Once all the tests have completed:
1. Stage Changes:
  - View your changes in the Source Control view.
  - Click on the + (plus) sign next to the files you wish to stage.
2. Commit Changes:
  - Enter a descriptive commit message.
  - Press Ctrl + Enter (or Cmd + Enter on macOS) to commit the changes.
3. Push Changes:
  - Click on the ellipsis ... in the Source Control view.
  - Select Push.
4.Verify you code has passed
